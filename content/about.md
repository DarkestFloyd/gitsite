Hi, I am Nischal, long time Android Developer turned data enthusiast. 24 year old, with a 
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Science at 
Northeastern University, Boston. [BTW, I use arch](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-btw-I-use-arch).

R is my go-to language for data analysis, and Python for everyday experimentation. 
At the moment, I am working on creating a Shiny dashboard for Cardinal 
under [Dr. Kylie Bemis](https://kuwisdelu.github.io).

I am fascinated by all things, from the pyramids to the ISS, from climate change to modern development,
from science to spritiality, I am open to chat and learn about anything. I hope to live a 100 years
to experience all that I can in the fleating time I have on this planet.
