Hi, I am Nischal, long time Android Developer turned data enthusiast. R is my go-to language 
for anything data related, and Python for everyday experimentation.

I am fascinated by all things, from pyramids to the ISS, from climate change to modern development,
from science to spritiality, I am open to chat and learn about anything. I hope to live a 100 years
to experience all that I can in the fleating time I have on this planet.

You would find me at my university pool or busy coding during my down times.
