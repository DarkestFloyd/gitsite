Hi, I am Nischal, long time Android Developer turned data enthusiast. 24 year old, with a 
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Science at 
Northeastern University, Boston. [BTW, I use arch](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-btw-I-use-arch).

R is my go-to language for data analysis, and Python for everyday experimentation. 
At the moment, I am working on creating a Shiny dashboard for Cardinal 
under [Dr. Kylie Bemis](https://kuwisdelu.github.io). The aim of the project is to provide
a interactive dashboard to assist with visual exploration and analysis of mass spectrometry
imaging data.

I love teaching. And learning. I live by Aerosmith's saying -- live and learn from fools and 
sages. Everyone has something to offer and I have a lot to learn. I have also served as a teaching
assistant at NEU for multiple courses and have enjoyed the talks I have with curious students.

I am fascinated by all things, from the pyramids to the ISS, from climate change to modern development,
from science to spritiality, I am open to chat and learn about anything. I hope to live a 100 years
to experience all that I can in the fleating time I have on this strange yet beautiful planet. 

Thats all floks, feel free to connect with me on any of the social networking sites or send 
me an email at [nischal.bhatewara@gmail.com](mailto:nischal.bhatewara@gmail.com).
